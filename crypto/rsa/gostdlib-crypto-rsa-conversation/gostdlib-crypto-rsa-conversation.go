	// with the public key of party2, party1 encrypts a message. Notice the
	// optional label. If party1 wants to send different types of messages
	// with the same public key of party2, the label can be used for switch
	// purposes. It can also be used to authorize the message - if party2
	// cannot see a legal label for a message, it can cancel the entire
	// decryption operation.

	// have the other's public key. And they each have to agree on a hash algorithm that
	// will be used for encryption. The same algorithm must be used in the signature.

	// you might be wondering, "when I use a browser to hit a TLS site, I don't have a customized
	// public key that I pass to the server as part of the TLS handshake." When using one-way
	// SSL/TLS, the browser must be passing a public key from the O/S root cert chain
	// on the device. Most likely it is coming from a cert for the browser product. At least,
	// it seems logical that this is what's happening in one-way TLS.

	// time for party2 to verify the signature and decrypt.

	// decryption by party2 first. Party2's private key is used. And because
	// party1 and party2 agreed on the hash algorithm and label, it's all cool.
