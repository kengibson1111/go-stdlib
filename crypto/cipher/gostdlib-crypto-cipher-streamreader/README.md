# crypto/cipher - streamreader

This shows how to get an encrypted stream and decrypt while reading using OFB. This example does not cover the use of HMAC after encryption for authentication purposes. The AES encryption algorithm is used. Pretty cool to demonstrate, but not realistic because of lack of authentication.
