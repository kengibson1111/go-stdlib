# bytes - index (rune)

This finds the first occurrence of the input rune in the input slice and returns the index where the rune was found within the input slice. If the rune is not found, IndexRune() returns -1. This is the same as the example for IndexByte(), but there is no need to cast the rune literal to a byte literal.
