# reflect - structtag

It looks like golang provides an easy way to parse JSON-like tags and values within a string. Very nice. You can reflect an internal type that is a struct with one string. The string value is intended to be like JSON tags and values. Get the one field value through reflection. Then get the tags. Maybe a way to extend this example is to look up tag names dynamically and grab values.
